ERRORS
1. error in creating the account in the
url http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dj_rest_auth/registration/
the code should be 201 (as per book) but it will say code 204.

2. no token is created after the admin create a new user account
see p.150
NOTE: token is generated when you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/rest-auth/login/
this is after making a POST. See p.152

3. when logging out in admin, error Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.

4. Logout is not working in http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/

TAKE NOTE!!!!

1. API has endpoints. It's like having a GET request at the end of the
link. OR a URLs with associated verbs (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE).
Read p.17
